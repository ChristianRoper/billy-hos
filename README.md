## Prerequisites

- Node
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

## Quick Start

The easiest way to view the site is by running it on Netlify. Click the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the website:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ChristianRoper/billy-hos&amp;stack=cms"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

Follow the steps with GitHub and then you'll need to setup Netlify Identity to log in to the CMS.
